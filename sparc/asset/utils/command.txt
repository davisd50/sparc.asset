# Command Launch Helper
This utility helps to identify and prepare lists that can be passed to 
subprocess.call().  We'll use the ZCA configured component to test this
utility.

    Ok, let's get an object
    >>> from zope.component import createObject
    >>> args = ['ping', ['-c', '1', 'www.google.com']]
    >>> myCommand = createObject(u'sparc.asset.command_launch', *args)
    
    now let's run the program
    >>> import subprocess
    >>> subprocess.call(myCommand)
    0
